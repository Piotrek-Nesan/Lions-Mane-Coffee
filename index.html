				<h1>How to make DIY Mushroom Coffee?</h1>

				<p>Medicinal mushrooms are somewhat of a new concept in West Yorkshire- but that’s not the case in other parts of the world.</p>

        <p>In fact, mushrooms have been used for thousands of years, trusted to support overall health, vitality, longevity, and most importantly, immunity.</p>

        <p>Now, people looking to get an edge and feel amazing everyday are adding mushrooms to their coffee for focus, energy, clarity, and mental performance.</p>

        <p>The benefits of functional mushrooms come from water soluble molecules known as beta-d glucans, powerful little molecules which are normally locked up in the cell wall of the mushroom fruiting body.</p>

        </p>Hot water extraction pulls these compounds out of the tough mushroom cell walls, and makes them bio-available.</p>

        <p>Medicinal mushrooms really are like a team of superheros.</p>

        <p>That's because each mushroom type has a uniquely shaped beta-d glucan, and is able to interact with your system in a unique way.</p>

	                Run the tap a little so the water's nicely aerated, and only boil it once to keep the oxygen level up. Oxygen in water helps flavour!
					</li>
					<li>
						Pop a desired amount of coffee into your mug (<em>always</em> a favourite mug)
					</li>
          <li>
            Add mushroom extract powder
					</li>
						Pour the hot (not boiling) water over the coffee and give it a good stir.
					</li>
					<li>
						Mushroom coffee needs time to unlock all its flavour, so give it 3-4 minutes to do its thing. This is a perfect time to daydream about vacations or psych yourself up for boost in your creativity.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you want, throw in some milk or sugar, honey, stevia or nothing else at all.
					</li>
					<li>
						Sip & Enjoy!
					</li>
